# Takeaway.com Assignment

The best takeaway.com assignment in the history of man. Known as the hello world.

## Getting Started

The assignment itself appears to be quite focused on frontend and does not really need a backend.
To keep things simple and spend a reasonable amount of time on this assignment, we are going to 
omit having a database and backend. A front end (javascript only) will be sufficient to meet the 
requirements.

Normally, we would also use tslint with typescript, however, for simplicity's sake, we are going to
omit tslint for this project.

### Prerequisites

You will need `npm`.

### Installing

Install the dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
